# Nikolay's Android Framework (NAF)

The framework that combines some of the modern technologies to create Android apps quickly and easily.
Under the hood are used at least: [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture?hl=zh-Hant), 
[Kotlin Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html) and [Flow](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/flow.html), 
[Cicerone](https://github.com/terrakok/Cicerone), 
[Dagger 2](https://github.com/google/dagger),
[Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit), 
etc.
Some of my libraries are also used: [Flow-Response-Retrofit-Adapter](https://github.com/NikolayMenzhulin/Flow-Response-Retrofit-Adapter), [Logger](https://github.com/NikolayMenzhulin/Logger).

At the moment, the framework consists of two components:
- [NAF Presentation Layer](https://github.com/NikolayMenzhulin/NAF/tree/main/sources/naf_presentation_layer) - to implement the presentation layer of the app.
- [NAF Service Layer](https://github.com/NikolayMenzhulin/NAF/tree/main/sources/naf_service_layer) - to implement the service layer of the app.
