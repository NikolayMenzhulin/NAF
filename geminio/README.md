# Geminio Templates

For the [NAF Presentation Layer](https://github.com/NikolayMenzhulin/NAF/tree/main/sources/naf_presentation_layer), templates for generating screens/dialogs/custom Dagger components are implemented.  
They are powered by the [Geminio](https://github.com/hhru/android-multimodule-plugin/tree/master/plugins/hh-geminio) plugin.

To use them, you need to do the following:
1. Install the Geminio plugin.
2. Copy the `geminio` folder to the root of your project.
3. In Android Studio settings, go to ***Appearance & Behavior -> Geminio plugin***  
   and specify the path to the `templates_config.yaml` file from the `geminio` folder.
4. Restart Android Studio.

If necessary, you can modify these templates to suit the needs of your project.
